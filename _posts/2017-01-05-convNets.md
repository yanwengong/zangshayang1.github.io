__These deeplearning series are inspired by Stanford open course â€” cs231n. My special thanks.__


_Deeplearning is involved in a wide range of techniques that allow a neural network to make reliable predications. This series will introduce several key components of a neural network, from linear classifier loss functions to fully connected neural nets, from convNets to RNN._

### Helper functions of convNets

Helper functions:
* pad image with 0 for some pixels;
* crop images;
* make square images into a bar of pixels;
* restore the image from a bar.

  Input:
  - x: Input image data of shape (N, C, H, W)

  Output:
  - padded image data

### Convolution layer

* Forward mapping and backward propagation in convNets are essentially the same thing as those in fully-connected neural nets.
* But in convNets, instead of sequentially assign weights to each pixel, it will slide a, typically 3 x 3 x H, 3D receptive field to extract spatial info. (what's above/left/right/below? What's the color? ... etc)
* Compared with a 7 x 7 x H receptive field, smaller receptive field tend to give higher nonlinearity and less parameters to update, which are advantages.

### ConvNets batch normalization

* This is based on the vanilla batch normalization implemented in fully-connected-nn post.

``` python
def spatial_batchnorm_forward(x, gamma, beta, bn_param):

  """
  Normally batch-normalization accepts inputs of shape (N, D) and produces outputs of shape (N, D), where we normalize across the minibatch dimension N.
    For data coming from convolutional layers, batch normalization needs to accept inputs of shape (N, C, H, W) and produce outputs of shape (N, C, H, W)
    where the N dimension gives the minibatch size and the (H, W) dimensions give the spatial size of the feature map.

  If the feature map was produced using convolutions, then we expect the statistics of each feature channel to be relatively consistent both between different images and different locations within the same image.
    Therefore spatial batch normalization computes a mean and variance for each of the C feature channels by computing statistics over both the minibatch dimension N and the spatial dimensions H and W.

  Computes the forward pass for spatial batch normalization.

  Inputs:
  - x: Input data of shape (N, C, H, W)
  - gamma: Scale parameter, of shape (C,)
  - beta: Shift parameter, of shape (C,)
  - bn_param: Dictionary with the following keys:
    - mode: 'train' or 'test'; required
    - eps: Constant for numeric stability
    - momentum: Constant for running mean / variance. momentum=0 means that
      old information is discarded completely at every time step, while
      momentum=1 means that new information is never incorporated. The
      default of momentum=0.9 should work well in most situations.
    - running_mean: Array of shape (D,) giving running mean of features
    - running_var Array of shape (D,) giving running variance of features

  Returns a tuple of:
  - out: Output data, of shape (N, C, H, W)
  - cache: Values needed for the backward pass
  """

  out, cache = None, None

  N, C, H, W = x.shape

  # imagine you are looking at the color channels of an image (C, H, W), then you take each channel as a feature and roll it out into (-1, C)

  # def batchnorm_forward(x, gamma, beta, bn_param): return out, cache;

###NOTE

with all the small building blocks defined above, of course you can stitch conv_layer - spatial_batchnorm - ReLU together to create a convenient layer as a bigger building block for your model. The design of a convNets architecture will be more challenging than a fully-connected architecture due to the difficulties to keep track of the input-output dimensions of each layer.
